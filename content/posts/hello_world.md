As many developers would know, the first step for any programmer is printing the iconic statement "Hello World" on the console to get acquainted with a new language and its environment. And just like how any good programmer would start their journey learning a new language, I'll be starting my blogging journey with my own type of Hello World!

Before getting into the swing of things, since this IS an introductory blog, it's only fitting that I introduce myself briefly and what's going on with me now.

Hi! My name is Daniel Park, but you can just call me Dan. I'm a current student at Olin (a quirky engineering school in Needham), majoring in Engineering in Computing (an even quirkier way of saying that I'm a Computer Science Major). I just finished my sophomore year here (halfway done!) and am spending my summer visiting my family in South Korea and working as a Business Enablement Solutions Analyst at Pfizer. I've been finding myself working within data science, analytics, and artificial intelligence roles and projects recently, so I guess, for now, that's what I'm working towards becoming in the future. Still, I always enjoyed trying out new technologies, for example, game development within VR, so who knows what I'll be doing in the future.

I could go on for a while, but I think that would be a good blog entry for another time. For this blog entry, I want to briefly talk about why I'm starting a blog in the first place (outside of the fact that I have always wanted to start my own blog.)

# Why a personal blog?

Since I was young, I have written all kinds of entries from novels, short stories, picture books, poems, and even journal entries (which I'm doing now). 

But as I got older, I want to say that by high school, I got caught up in my other activities and obligations that I started to write less as a hobby and more within a classroom setting. And because of the classroom's standardized grading procedure when it comes to writing which was basically five paragraphs, three main bullet points, and a conclusion restating everything from earlier in the essay. And with such a rigid way of writing, I lost a lot of the "writer's touch" I had when I was younger. So I lost my sense of writing freedom and complexity when I got into more creative and classroom writing in college. My professors and peers noticed that my writing was highly blocky, creating a dull and often juvenile experience for them reading my work.

# What's the best way to go back to my roots as a writer and improve my skills as a writer?

By writing! 

And not just only "writing." I'll be learning more about writing by taking courses and reading books and whatnot (there's this excellent book called "On Writing" from Stephen King that I've been meaning to read.) This blog will be one of my many outlets to practice my newfound writing skills. So hopefully, by this time, let's say next year? I'll look back at this blog and say, "Wow, I really stunk at writing back then, huh."

# What am I going to write about in this blog? 

Well, for now, I wanted to keep it professional and write solely programming entries, which I will be doing. Still, I decided against restricting myself to those topics. Thinking of what my blog is going to be like on my flight back to South Korea this summer, I want my blog to be a life story: a recollection of thoughts and events of my life that I put into my writing form so eventually me, or maybe even many others after me, will also read what I have to say.

And with that being said, I will also make sure to keep my blogs under at least 1000 words, preferably 750 for the more "technical" blogs I eventually write. No one wants to read a twenty-three-page thesis just to extract a simple one-liner, let alone a random nineteen year old's rants on the internet, so keeping this short and to the point will be my priority. And in my blogs, I will also include lots of pictures to make reading and understanding things a more pleasurable experience.

Well, that should be it for my "Hello World" blog. If you made it this far, you should read my other stuff (if any are, depending on how early you land on this page). I'll be updating my blog frequently with all kinds of goodies from my professional and personal life perspectives. 

For now,
See You Later, World!
